System Monitoring

Basic mail interface to System Monitoring Suites. Also provides deeper integration to Nagios (Acknowledge on lock and Checkscript).

In order to correct check its functionality, if you want to use it together with SupportDB, this last one should be
correctly installed, this means the Archive::Tar module should be installed for the correct functionality of SupportDB package.

The mentioned module can come from Support package or directly from CPAN.
