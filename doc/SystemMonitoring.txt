NAME
    Kernel::System::PostMaster::Filter::SystemMonitoring - Basic System
    Monitoring Interface

SYNOPSIS
    This module implemets a basic interface to System Monitoring Suites. It
    works by receiving email messages sent by the Monitoring Suite. New
    tickets are created in case of component failures. Once a ticket has
    been opened messages regarding the effected component are attached to
    this ticket. When the component recovers, the ticket state can be
    changed or the ticket can be closed.

    Once a open ticket for a given Host/Service combination exists, all
    mails concerning this particular combination will be attached to the
    ticket until it's closed.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
    To allow flexible integration between OTRS and a System Monitoring Suite
    the following configuration options are available. The default values
    (as shown below) should be suitable for a standard Nagios installation.

    * "FromAddressRegExp"
        Only mails matching this "From:" address will be considered for this
        filter. You need to adjust this setting to the from address your
        System Monitoring Suite uses for outgoing mails.

        Default: 'sysmon@mysystem.com'

    * "StateRegExp"
        Regular Expression to extract "State"

        Default: '\s*State:\s+(\S+)'

    * "NewTicketRegExp"
        Regular expression for extracted "State" to trigger new ticket

        Default: 'CRITICAL|DOWN'

    * "CloseTicketRegExp"
        Regular expression for extracted "State" to trigger ticket
        transition to "CloseActionState"

        Default: 'OK|UP'

    * "CloseActionState"
        New status for ticket when service recoveres. This can be either
        "OLD" in which case the old status stays, or the name of the new
        status. Please note, that this state needs to be configured in your
        OTRS installation as valid state. If the state you set here does not
        exist, the ticket state will not be altered.

        Default: 'closed successful'

    * "ClosePendingTime"
        Pending time in seconds for 'Pending...' status time. (Ignored for
        other status types). Please note that this setting will be ignored
        by OTRS versions older than 2.2. On these systems the pending time
        already associated with the ticket will be used, which may have in
        surprising effects. It's recommended not to use 'Pending...' states
        with OTRS prior to 2.2.

        Default: "60*60*24*2" (2 days)

    * "HostRegExp"
        Regular expression to extract "Host"

        Default: '\s*Address:\s+(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\s*'

    * "FreeTextHost"
        Free text field index to store "Host"

        Default: '1'

    * "ServiceRegExp"
        Regular expression to extract "Service"

        Default: '\s*Service:\s+(.*)\s*'

    * "DefaultService"
        Default for "Service"; used if no service can be extracted, i.e. if
        host goes DOWN/UP

        Default: 'Host'

    * "FreeTexyService"
        Free text field index to store service

        Default: '2'

    * "SenderType"
        Sender type used for creating tickets and attaching notes

        Default: "system"

    * "ArticleType"
        Article type used to attach follow up emails to existing tickets

        Default: "note-report"

CONTROL FLOW
    The following diagram illustrates how mails are handled by this module
    and in which cases they trigger which action. Pretty much all checks are
    configable using the regular expressions given by the parameters listed
    above.

     Mail matches 'FromAddress'?
     |
     +-> NO  -> Continue with regular mail processing
     |
     +-> YES -> Does a ticket with matching Host/Service combination
                already exist in OTRS?
                |
                +-> NO  -> Does 'State:' match 'NewTicketRegExp'?
                |          |
                |          +-> NO  -> Stop processing this mail
                |          |          (silent drop)
                |          |
                |          +-> YES -> Create new ticket, record Host
                |                     and Service, attach mail
                |
                +-> YES -> Attach mail to ticket
                        -> Does 'State:' match 'CloseTicketRegExp'?
                           |
                           +-> NO  -> Continue with regular mail processing
                           |
                           +-> YES -> Change ticket type as configured in
                                      'CloseActionState'

    Besides of a few additional sanity checks this is how the
    SystemMonitoring modul treats incoming mails. By changing the regular
    expressions it should be possible to adopt it to different monitoring
    systems.
