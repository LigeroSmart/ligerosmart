        <title>Create new Survey</title>
        <para>
            This feature lets OTRS users create new Survey by selecting the menu "SURVEY"
            and choosing "New".
        </para>
        <para>
            New Surveys require a title, an introduction text, a sender mail address, a mail
            subject, a mail body and an internal description of the Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            Additionally the new Survey can be created for just some queues, ticket types or services.
            If none are selected, it will be valid for every queue, ticket type annd service.
            As default the send condition check for ticket types or services are disabled. So the fields aren't displayed in the mask (new and edit mask for a survey).
        </para>
        <para>
            It is also possible to define conditions based on customer user attributes,
            e.g. all customer users with a specified comment would not get any survey emails.
            The attributes are selectable in the masks "AgentSurveyAdd" and "AgentSurveyEdit".
            Each attribute could have at least one condition.
            A condition contains a checkbox value for negation and a value field (input type text or multiple select).
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Add Questions</title>
        <para>
            As soon as a new Survey is created, the user can add questions to this Survey by
            clicking "Edit Questions" in the displayed Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            A new window will pop up. In there the user can add questions.
        </para>
        <para>
            Five types of questions are selectable. These are:
        </para>
        <para>
            "YesNo" questions a user can answer by selecting "Yes" or "No" of a drop down select.
        </para>
        <para>
            "Radio (List)" questions a user can answer by selecting exactly one and just one of the
            possible answers.
        </para>
        <para>
            "Checkbox (List)" questions a user can answer by selecting none to all listed answers.
        </para>
        <para>

        </para>
        <para>
            "Net Promoter Score" questions a user can answer by selecting exactly one and just one of the
            possible scores.
        </para>
        <para>
            For each answer type the OTRS user can choose
            if he wants a customer to be required to answer this question or if a customer can
            ignore the question.
        </para>
        <para>
            As soon as questions of type "Radio (List)", "Checkbox (List)" or "Net Promoter Score" got added, the question
            will be shown in the "Survey Questions"-List. By clicking on the question the user can
            add answers, change the answer order by clicking the "UP" or "DOWN" icon, or delete the
            answer by clicking the "DELETE" icon.
        </para>
        <para>
            Questions of type "Radio (List)" and "Net Promoter Score" needs to have at least two answers to be valid.
            Furthermore, questions of type "Checkbox (List)" needs to have at least one answer to be valid.
        </para>

        <para>
            Questions where answers were configured as "required" will have one vote for each
            customer submitted Survey.
        </para>
        <para>
            Questions where answers were not configured as "required" are optional for the customer.
            This means that for example 200 customers submitted the Survey but in the statistic in
            total only 10 or 20 answers may occur, if customers did not select any of the Radio
            (List), YesNo or checkbox answers or haven't put anything in a textarea answer.
        </para>
        <para>
            Statistics for required Checkbox (List) questions will have at least one checked value
            for every submitted Survey but due to it's nature of been multiple clickable there may
            be more answers than the total amount of submitted Surveys. Example: 200 Surveys
            submitted by customers, 350 answers on one Checkbox (List) question.
        </para>
        <para>
            Statistics for not required questions may have less votes than the total amount of
            submitted Surveys (answer is optional).

        <title>Statistics Details</title>
        <para>
            By selecting "SURVEY" from the menu, choosing "Overview", clicking on a Survey that
            customers already submitted and choosing "Stats Details" you can see a list containing
            the time the Survey invitation was sent to the customer, the time the customer submitted
            his filled Survey, the Ticket (clickable) and a magnifying glass that shows the selected
            votes for this customer.
        </para>
        <para>
            In there you can find the answers the customer chose or typed in question by question.
        </para>
        <para>
            Especially Textarea answers are of interest in here.

    <section>
        <title>Modifying Survey</title>
        <para>
            As soon as a Survey had the Status "Master" the possible modifications are limited. So
            please make sure to have especially the amount of questions as well as the amount of
            answers correctly configured before changing it's status to Master.
        </para>
        <warning>
            <para>
                In a Survey of type "Master" you can not add or delete questions any more.
            </para>
        </warning>
        <para>
            In a Survey of type Master you can change the general info (e.g. Title, Introduction,
            Sender,...), the question text, the answer text, as well as the order of the answers.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can change the "Answer Required" part of a question too, but this may just make
            sense as long as there are no submitted customer Surveys.
        </para>
        <para>
            Changing a "Answer Required" Question to answer not required makes the answer optional,
            so the statistic for this question may not have an answer for each submitted customer
            Survey any more.
        </para>
        <para>
            Changing a "Answer not Required" Question to answer required will require future Survey
            customers to give a vote for this question, but will not add votes for already submitted
            Surveys. So statistics will render rather useless too.

        This module adds the following database tables:
        survey,
        survey_answer,
        survey_question,
        survey_queue,
        survey_request,
        survey_vote.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey table holds the general information of a survey and the send condition information for a survey.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey_answer holds the answers for a survey questions.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey_question holds all question related information as well as if an answer is
        required or not.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey_queue table holds a record for each queue a survey is added.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey_request table holds a record for each request sent to a customer,
        as well as the time, a customer has submitted the survey he was invited to.
    </para>
    <para>
        The survey_vote table holds a reference to the corresponding request and question
        as well as the chosen answers.
    </para>
    <!--
            OK, so far for the users and now for the developers underneath us:

            Add a new send condition:

            - The send condition are stored in a yaml structure.
            - In the Survey.pm the function "_BuildSendConditionStrg" generate the yaml structure.
            The function is used in the two functions "SurveyAdd" and "SurveyUpdate". So these two functions
            need a new optional parameter for the new send condition (similar the ticket type or service).
            - The function "SurveyGet" in the Survey.pm return the new send condition as a own parameter.
            - Now the check for the new send condition must be added in the function "RequestSend" from the
            Request.pm (similar the ticket type or service).
            - Optional you can add a Setting for the send condition.
            - The last step is to add the new send condition in the new and edit mask for the survey. Also it can be
            added in the detail survey view.
